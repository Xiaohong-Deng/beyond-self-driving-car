# Beyond Self-Driving Car Projects
## Overview
This is a summary of the projects I have built, am building and will build in the context of self-driving car and hopefully, robotics and computer vision which are closely related to self-driving car.
## Projects I built for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nano Degree
### Term 1
* [Basic Lane Lines Detection][0]
* [German Traffic Signs Classifier][1]
* [Behavioral Cloning][2]
* [Advanced Lane Lines Detection][3]
* [Vehicle Detection][4]
### Term 2
* [Extended Kalman Filter][5]
* [Unscented Kalman Filter][6]
* [Kidnapped Vehicle][7]
* [PID Control][8]
* [Model Predictive Control][9]
### Term 3
* [Path Planning][10]
* [Semantic Segmentation][11]
* [CarROS Self-Driving Car][12]

## Projects Inspired by Udacity Self-Driving Car Nano Degree
* [YOLOv3 Vehicle Detection][13]

Lane Lines Detection with CNN? (Data Collecting is a big problem for me, check out [Michael Virgo's work][14])

Self-Driving Mario Kart with Behavioral Cloning?

[Self-Driving RC car][15] (Under Construction)

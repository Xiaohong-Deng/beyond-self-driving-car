# Beyond Self-Driving Car Projects
## Overview
This is a summary of the projects I have built, am building and will build in the context of self-driving car and hopefully, robotics and computer vision which are closely related to self-driving car.
## Projects I built for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nano Degree
### Term 1
* [Basic Lane Lines Detection][0]
* [German Traffic Signs Classifier][1]
* [Behavioral Cloning][2]
* [Advanced Lane Lines Detection][3]
* [Vehicle Detection][4]
### Term 2
* [Extended Kalman Filter][5]
* [Unscented Kalman Filter][6]
* [Kidnapped Vehicle][7]
* [PID Control][8]
* [Model Predictive Control][9]
### Term 3
Coming soon

## Projects Inspired by Udacity Self-Driving Car Nano Degree
Object Detection with YOLOor R-CNN?

Lane Lines Detection with CNN?

Self-Driving Mario Kart with Behavioral Cloning?

Object Detector or Self-Driving RC Car in Raspberry Pi?
